      <p>There are lots of resources to learn Euterpea. 
The most developed is the textbook, Haskell School of Music by Paul Hudak.
 It is freely available online from the <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu">Yale Haskell Group</a>.
 Every year a course is taught at Yale about Computer Music using Euterpea.
 Homework assignments can be viewed on the <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/cpsc-431-531/">course website</a>.
 For more offical documentation you can check the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Euterpea">Hackage page</a>, or view the lastest version on <a href="https://github.com/Euterpea/Euterpea">github</a>.</p>
      <p>We are also developing some tutorials so you can learn by example here.
 In addition to some bite size walkthroughs, we will also be posting user submitted code.
 If you make something you would like us to show off, just email Mark the source file!</p>
